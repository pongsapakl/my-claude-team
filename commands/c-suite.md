Initiate a C-Suite meeting to discuss the following topic:

{The topic or question I want the C-Suite to debate}

Use the c-suite-meeting skill to orchestrate a round-robin debate between CEO, CTO, CMO, CFO, and Product Lead agents.

Pause after each agent's perspective to get my input.
Continue rounds until I say "synthesize" or we reach convergence.
Then provide a final recommendation with trade-offs clearly explained.

Document the full discussion in a session log when complete.
